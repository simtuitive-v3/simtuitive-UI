                transmit to other persons (hereinafter, “post”) content or materials (collectively, “User
                Contributions”) on or through the Website. All User Contributions must comply with the Content Standards
                set out in this Policy.<br><br>

                (b) Any User Contribution that you post will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary, to the
                extent
                permitted by law. By providing a User Contribution, you grant the Company and its successors the right
                to use,
                reproduce, modify, perform, display, distribute and otherwise disclose to third parties any such
                material. You
                promise that you own or control all rights in and to the User Contributions and have the right to grant
                such license
                to us. You agree that you will have no claim or other recourse against the Company for infringement of
                any

                the right to be attributed as the author of the User Contributions.<br><br>

                (c) If you provide a User Contribution to be transmitted to other users of the Website or any third
                parties, you
                accept that your User Contributions are posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk.
                Additionally, we
                cannot control the actions of other users of the Website or any third parties with whom you may choose
                to share your
                User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be
                viewed by
                unauthorized persons.<br><br>

                (d) User Contributions must be accurate and comply with all applicable laws in the country from which
                they are
                posted. You understand and acknowledge that you are responsible for any User Contributions you submit or
                contribute,
                and you, not the Company, have fully responsibility for such content, including its legality,
                reliability, accuracy

                <div class="section-title">5. CONTENT STANDARDS</div>
                These content standards apply to all User Contributions and use of Interactive Services, if offered.
                User
                Contributions must in their entirety comply with all applicable local and international laws and

                We have the right, but not the obligation, to review, screen or edit any User Contribution. You accept
                that such
                contributions do not reflect the views of Company and are not endorsed by the Company.<br><br>

                requesting or
                directing us to disclose the identity or other information of anyone posting any materials on or through
                the
                Website. We do not undertake to review material before it is posted on the Website, and cannot ensure
                prompt removal
                of objectionable material after it has been posted. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any action
                or inaction
                regarding transmissions, communications or content provided by any user or third-party. We have no
                liability or
                responsibility to anyone for performance or non-performance of the activities described in this

                You acknowledge that a breach of any confidentiality or proprietary rights provision of this Policy may
                cause the
                Company irreparable damage, for which the award of damages would not be adequate compensation.
                Consequently, the
                Company may institute an action to enjoin you from any and all acts in violation of those provisions,
                which remedy
                shall be cumulative and not exclusive, and the Company may seek the entry of an injunction enjoining any
                breach or
                threatened breach of those provisions, in addition to any other relief to which the Company may be
                entitled at law

                <div class="section-title"> 17. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE</div>
                This Policy shall be construed and governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to
                the principles
                of conflict of laws thereof. You agree and accept that any legal action or proceeding shall be brought
                in the
                federal or state courts for the State of California, County of Santa Clara, and you expressly waive any
                objection to

                be governed
                by the laws of the EU/EEA member state in which you are domiciled.<br><br>

                <div class="section-title"> 18. SEVERABILITY</div>
                If any provision of this Policy is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such
                provision
                shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the original provision to
                the fullest

                conditions,
                or if the Company fails to exercise any of the rights or remedies to which it is entitled under this
                Policy, this
                will not constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies and will not relieve you from compliance with
                such
                obligations. No waiver by the Company of any default will constitute a waiver of any subsequent default,
                and no
                waiver by the Company of any of these terms and conditions will be effective unless it is expressly
                stated to be a
